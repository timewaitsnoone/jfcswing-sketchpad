# CSE 3461 User Interfaces: Fall 2013
## Assignment 2

Due Friday, December 6, 2011 midnight in groups of 3

Develop a JFC/Swing application that implements a drawing application.   The
application should include a variety of drawing capabilities, as typically found
in commercial drawing applications.  These include, but are not limited to,
drawing objects such as squares, circles, lines, etc., free-hand drawing,
inserting text; inserting an image from a file, operations for specifying line
color, and thickness, and fill color; zoom in, zoom out, undo; save; save asâ€¦,
open, etc.   Can you think of additional features that might be useful?

Please do not include Java code from other sources.  Use only your own code and
the classes packaged with the Java SDK.  Good luck.

### Notes:

1.  Your application should be robust with a good user interface. Make
    appropriate use of the various GUI components and features supported in
    JFC/Swing. Consider the organization, presentation, interaction, and over-all
    usability of your program.
2.  Your source code should be well organised and documented.
3.  You must do this assignment in groups of three.
4.  Do not use the york package or the type package.
5.  Your programs must compile and run in the Prism lab.
6.  The assignments will be awarded letter grades, according to the university's
    letter grade standard. A program that simply fulfils the requirements described
    here will be awarded a 'C'. To get a higher grade, we want to see "an excellent
    job and originality" in your assignment solution.
7.  Name your program 'a2.java'. Submit it on Prism with 'submit 3461 a2
    a2.java'. Additional files, if required, may be submitted using the same
    command, with the filename as the last argument. (Use 'man submit' for further
    details on using the submit command.)
8.  Also submit a text file named readme.txt in which you describe the
    motivation behind your software design. Why did you use the JFC/Swing and HTML
    components that you did, and why did you organise them that way? Briefly justify
    your design. If your implementation includes any special features, make sure you
    describe these and provide appropriate instructions.
9.  The readme.txt file should also contain a record of your group meetings.
    Include the date and time of each meeting, the people present, and the topics
    discussed. If other forms of communication were used (e.g., e-mail, phone),
    indicate the type and extent. Also include in your `readme.txt` file a record of
    the tasks assigned and performed by each member of the team.
10. Please make sure the first three lines of the readme.txt are formatted
    exactly as shown in the template file; namely,

    ```
      LoginID, StudentID, LastName, FirstName(s)
      LoginID, StudentID, LastName, FirstName(s)
      LoginID, StudentID, LastName, FirstName(s)
    ```
